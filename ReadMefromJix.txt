
To launch my project you fist need to run the index.js located in the main 'denzel' folder. It will start my API connected to my mongoDB server. 

Then you will find my React app into my denzelapp and you will just have to start it !

I decided to have two collections in my DB. In fact, one is dedicated 
to the Reviews.
